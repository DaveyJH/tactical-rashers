# Assessment Guide

This assessment guide covers both the DRF back end and the React front end. Items that are not relevant to the front end have a strikethrough styling applied to them.

## Learning Outcomes

- [ ] LO1 | Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS and advanced JavaScript, based on component composition and separation of concerns.
- [ ] LO2 | Explain the key role that specialist Front-End developers perform in modern software development/delivery teams.
- [ ] ~~LO3 | Create an Application Programming Interface for consumption by 3rd party applications.~~
- [ ] LO4 | Create an Interactive Front-End application that consumes API data.

## LO1 Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS and advanced JavaScript, based on component composition and separation of concerns

- [ ] 1.1 | Design a Front-End for a Full-Stack web application that meets accessibility guidelines, follows the principles of UX design, meets its given purpose and provides a set of user interactions.
- [ ] 1.2 | Implement custom JSX (HTML, JavaScript and CSS) code to create a responsive, dynamic Front-End application consisting of one or more pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions.
- [ ] 1.3 | Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (comments, indentation, consistent and meaningful naming conventions).
- [x] 1.4 | Name files consistently and descriptively, without spaces, capitalisation where recommended, to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
- [ ] 1.5 | Document the deployment process for the Front-End application in the README file for the Front-End application.
- [x] 1.6 | Ensure the security of the deployed version of the Front-End application, making sure to not include any passwords in the git repository, and that all secret keys are hidden in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore, if applicable.
- [x] 1.7 | Implement modular use of components and separation of concerns by incorporating component-specific files (i.e. one JavaScript file and, where applicable, one CSS file per component).
- [x] 1.8 | Include class and/or functional components to build the application.
- [x] 1.9 | Design a responsive Front-End application with the use of a Front-End library which is compatible with React.
- [ ] 1.10 | Write code that correctly handles user interactions such as clicks, changes to input fields etc.
- [x] 1.11 | Design a Front-End web application that lets the user initiate and control actions.
- [ ] 1.12 | Implement manual testing and document the procedures and results in the README file for the Front-End application.
- [x] 1.13 | Use Git & GitHub for version control of the Front-End application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process.
- [ ] 1.14 | Deploy a final version of the Front-End application code to a cloud-based hosting platform and test to ensure it matches the development version.

## LO2 Explain the key role that specialist Front-End developers perform in modern software development/delivery teams

- [ ] 2.1 | Demonstrate an understanding of the React architecture by documenting the reuse of components in the README file for the Front-End application.
- [x] 2.2 | Document the UX design work undertaken for the Front-End application, including any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process and its reasoning. Include diagrams created as part of the design process and demonstrate that these have been followed through to implementation.
- [ ] 2.3 | Describe what you set out to achieve in creating this application (project goals).
- [ ] 2.4 | Document all User Stories and map them to the project goals in the README file for the Front-End application.
- [x] 2.5 | Use Github Projects to implement Agile project management methodology with User Stories mapped to relevant sprints.
- [ ] 2.6 | Document Front-End libraries you have used for specific features included in the application and justify your choice in the README file for the Front-End application.

## LO4 Create an Interactive Front-End application that consumes API data

- [x] 4.1 | Create a complete set of CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality on the Front-End for users to work with records from an API.
- [ ] 4.2 | All changes to the data should be notified to the relevant user on the Front-End application.
- [ ] 4.3 | Display and manipulate API data on the Front-End application in a way that brings value to the user and aligns with the project's purpose.
- [x] 4.4 | Implement exception-handling for user actions when communicating with the API, and relay any relevant feedback to the user on the Front-End application.
- [ ] 4.5 | Write JSX code that passes through a linter (e.g. eslint) with no significant issues affecting functionality.
- [x] 4.6 | In the Front-End application, implement at least TWO forms, with validation, that allow users to create and edit resources in the Back-End API.
- [x] 4.7 | Ensure that the current login state is evident to the user in the Front-End application.
- [ ] 4.8 | Ensure that the final deployed code is free of commented out code and has no broken internal links, or broken links to the API.
