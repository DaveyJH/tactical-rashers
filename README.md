## Objective

This site is to represent capabilities with React. It will connect with a DRF
back end, allowing full CRUD functionality with well handled user interactions.

The assessment checklist is available to view in the
[`docs/` directory](https://github.com/DaveyJH/tactical-rashers/tree/main/docs)
of the project repository.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely for the
purpose of completing my Code Institute project***

***

## Brief

### Tactical Rashers

Tactical Rashers : a backgammon players' site.  

The site should allow users to play backgammon in a manner similar to
["Chess by post"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess). Users
will be able to play private games, with dice rolls handled via the app, and
comment with their intended moves. They should be able to update the main image
of the game to the latest state of a board and should be able to declare a
winner.

Full CRUD functionality should be available to allow users to interact
appropriately with the various aspects of the finished application. This repo
intends to provide a well-presented front-end React application that interfaces
seamlessly with a DRF back end.

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

### User Requirements

Some example user stories that will affect the design. Please consult the
[GitHub project board](https://github.com/users/DaveyJH/projects/8/views/4) for
a full list of user concerns written in the form of GitHub issues.
Alternatively, a
[status graph can be viewed here](https://github.com/users/DaveyJH/projects/8/insights/6).

Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the user stories. Some of these are
key user stories that must be achieved for an MVP to be considered complete:

#### First Time User

> *"As a **potential player**, I would like to be able to **read the rules of
> the game** so that I **know how to play**"*
>
> *"As a **potential user**, I would like to be **able to create a profile** so
> that I **am able to play**"*

#### Returning User

> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **quickly determine whether I am
> logged in** so that I can **log in / out as needed**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **log in to my account** so that I
> can **interact with the features of the site**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like to **view my currently active games**
> so that I can **track the progress of, and make new moves on, my games in
> play**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like **to play a game with another
> player** so that I can **enjoy the game of backgammon**"*
>
> *"As a **returning user**, I would like **to comment on completed games** so
> that I can **interact with other users of the site**"*

***

### Initial Concept

The front-end application should provide a good UI/UX for users of the site. It
should implement the functionality of the DRF back end in a user-friendly and
error-free manner.

As a lover of board games, the application may, in time, develop into a much
broader database and front end that could allow for various types of social
games to be played remotely. For this iteration, a proof of concept and MVP is
to implement a playable backgammon application. There will be no interactive
game board due to time constraints, so the game will be played via the means of
descriptive moves being posted by each player.
